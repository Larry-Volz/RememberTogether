Questions to ask:

- is this model something funeral directors would use?
    - Zoom Service w/live chat
    - memorial board panel/upload memories
    - permanent memorial board that (opt.) can upload to facebook and/or instagram
- What in the market is like it?
- Are funeral directors the target market?
- What pricing model is appropriate?  Subscription or a permanent memorial wall?  Put it on facebook for permanence?  Maybe a subscription to funeral directors and they can re-sell it to clients?
- What kind of wholesale/retail and affiliate program pricing would make it worth someone aggressively marketing it?
- How would you market it/suggest I market it/who would be good to work with?
- Are you interested in marketing it for a commission?  What would make it worth your time?
- Any ideas for pre-funding it with Kickstarter

# Funding possibilities
