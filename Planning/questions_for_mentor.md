# questions for mentor
- I keep getting the following error (How to fix/prevent?):

` sqlalchemy.exc.OperationalError: (psycopg2.OperationalError) FATAL:  too many connections for role "ncewshwz" `

- What's up with the errors when I do ipython, %run app.py?  How can I debug if I can't play with the variables over there?
- What's up with the flowers page getting wonky and the columns going behind the navigation sidebar?  (Maybe model what I did with flash on that page)
