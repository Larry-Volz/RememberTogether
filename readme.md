# RememberTogether
A memorial website-building and Flower shop web app for funeral directors and grieving families.  I will be deploying through virtual-memorials.net and am offering it free to funeral directors and individuals.  I only ask that we work together to maintain the flower-shop so I may gain some revenue if anyone chooses to buy through those links.  I am partnering with Florist One who are rated 4+ stars and are very reliable vendors.

## Design & Use case
This is a Flask/Postgres app using WTForms for validation, SQLAlchemy, Bootstrap and jQuery.  

Funeral directors can work with me to white-label it and add their own logo, etc. and offer it to their clients as an easy way to make a beautiful and easy memorial website.  All they have to do is fill out a form and upload the pictures they would like.  They can then send the link to friends and family so others can add pictures and share memories as well.

There is a link to purchase flowers that is connected (securely) to Florist One's REST API. 

If you would like to deploy it please feel free to contact me.
